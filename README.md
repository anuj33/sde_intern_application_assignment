Have used api medic public apis for below two apis
API : "/fetch_all_symptoms", methods=["GET"]
output - will load all symtoms present in apimedic database

API: "/fetch_proposed_symptom", methods=["POST"]
output - proposed symptom based on symptoms, gender, birth year

API - "/fetch_treatement_option_by_medical_condition", methods=["GET"]
output - top two treatement options available on wikipedia
algorithm - scrape data from wikipedia page in management section. it is not fool proof but i can find only wikipedia as a best option
